It is important to remember that those are averages, so if you have almost 90,000 in IOS, you could also have just two apps, one with 180,000 reviews and the other with barely 1, so the mean would be around 90.000 as well.

    "Are Android and IOS users downloading/using the same kind of apps? Surely, not. In fact, Android games seems to be quite a populated one, but it also is full of possibilities based on what our company wants, which is in-app adds, and that is centainly related to the Android user's phylosophy, where they are more likely to get a free-to-use app than pay for one. But, considering that our company also needs to grow or see some revenue before launching it on IOS, which have shown to have more fun-related apps, this road might be too complicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, books and news seems to have a decent amount of competition but a solid niche of users as well in both stores. Considering the amount of features and improvements that could be created, all the options for in-app adds, and the fact that Android users tend to have a more balanced selection of apps downloaded, it may ease the transition from Android to IOS eventually, therefore our company may want to prefer to develop these kinds of apps first."
