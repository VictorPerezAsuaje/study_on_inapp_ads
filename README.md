# study_on_inapp_ads
For this project, I'll pretend I'm working as data analysts for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps. This company make their apps available on Google Play and the App Store.  They only build apps that are free to download and install, and their main source of revenue consists of in-app ads.
